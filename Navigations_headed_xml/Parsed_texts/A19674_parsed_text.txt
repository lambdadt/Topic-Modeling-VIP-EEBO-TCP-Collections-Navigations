A
RELATION BY WAY
OF
IOVRNALL, &c.


T
HE seventh of 
April
 being

Thursday,
 1636. His Excellency
departed from 
Greenwich
 for

Germanie,
 tooke Barge about
three of the clocke in the mor∣ning,
and landed at 
Gravesend,

from thence by Coach to 
Can∣terbury

to bed, the next day to

Margate
 where wee dined, and about three of the
clocke in the afternoone, hee tooke shipping in one of
the Kings Ships called the 
Happy Entrance,
 and landed
the tenth day being Sunday at 
Helver-sluce,
 and from
thence to the 
Brill,
 there sailing over a lake into 
Masans∣sluce,

and so on by waggons to 
Delph,
 and to the 
Hage:

but a mile before wee came thither, there met us some
of the 
Queene of Bohemia's
 Coaches, which her Majesty
sent for his Excellency, and in one of them his Excel∣lency
went to her Majesty that night, the time we staid
there, was spent in visits betweene the 
Prince
 of 
Orange,



his Excellency and the States, with some other Am∣bassadours,
that were then there, as the 
French, Veneti∣an,

and the 
Swedish,
 heere we staid three daies, and de∣parted
the fourteenth day by wagons, passing through

Leiden
 to 
Woerden,
 and then entred the Bishopricke of

Utrecht,
 and so to the City it selfe where wee lay, the
Princes being there at schoole, his Excellency went
to see them that night, the next day thence to 
Rhenem

to dine, where the Queene hath an house adjacent to
the 
Rhine,
 on the left side, which wee viewed, having
faire roomes and gardens belonging to it, after diner,
wee entered into 
Gelder-land,
 so through 
Wagening
 to

Arnheim
 to bed, passing that afternoone through
much danger, by reason of Out-lyers from the Army
at 
Schenckenschans,
 which was not farre off, the Prince
of 
Brandeburgh
 being heere in Towne, visited his Ex∣cellency
the next day, and the day after his Excellen∣cy
visited him, who was shewed by him, the ashes of
some 
Romanes
 preserved in pots, that were found
in a Mountaine called 
Zanten,
 which wee afterward
passed by, heere wee lay 
Easter-day
 and the 
Munday

following, and did see the smoake and fire out of
the great Peeces from the 
Sconee,
 as they were in
skirmish, thether his Excellency sent the Steward
and a Trumpeter to demand passage of the Spanyard
in the 
Schans,
 and 
Grave William
 for the Hollander,
but the Spaniard would not grant it, without order
from 
Brussels, Grave William
 hearing their answer, sent
his Excellency word, hee made no doubt, but to give
him free passage the next day, for he resolved to make
an assault that night upon the 
Sconce,
 upon the assault,
the Spaniards yeelded it up on conditions, and heere


his Excellency published certaine orders, to be gene∣rally
observed amongst us, one reason was, the sicke∣nesse,
being heere very much, wee staid heere three
daies and departed the nineteenth in waggons for the

Schans,
 first crossed over the 
Rhine
 just by the towne on
to the right side into 
Cleveland,
 and so to the 
Tolhouse,

a Castle where the Hollanders take toll at, adjoyning
to the 
Rhine
 on the same side, then passing through all
their workes and Army, leaving the 
Schans
 at a di∣stance
which was miserably battered, untill wee came
to 
Grave William
 his Tent,
 where some of the Spa∣niards
were sealing of their agreements what quarter
they should have, who instantly left them, to bring
his Excellency over the 
Rhine
 on a Bridge of flat bot∣tom'd
Boates, guarded with all his Troopes of Horse,
untill wee came at the Barke wherein his Excellency
lay that night, then returned and sent a Company of
English Souldiers to guard it, the next day earely wee
weighed Anchor and sailed up the 
Rhine,
 having a
Guard of Souldiers along the shore, by reason the
Enemy went out of the 
Schans
 that morning, so pas∣sing
by 
Emmerick
 and 
Rees,
 Townes with strong scon∣ces
adjoyning to the 
Rhine
 on the left side, then in sight
of the Mountaine 
Zanten
 on the other side, so by 
Bu∣rick,

on the same side, to 
Wesell
 a Towne on the left
side of the 
Rhine,
 against which wee cast Anchor, and
lay on ship-board all night, for they died there of the
sickenesse more than thirty a day, neverthelesse the
next morning we tooke waggons in number eighteen
and displaied our English colours in three severall
wagons, passing over a little River in Boats call'd 
Lipp,

then by 
Rheinbergh
 on the right hand being the last


Towne of the States, then by 
Dinslacken,
 on the same
side to 
Dinsburgh
 to dinner, where none of our carriage
might enter in, for as his Excellency entered the gate,
one of the watch discharged his peece neere unto the
horses breast, the rest being instantly commanded to
the contrary, but the Gates were shut up, and wee
kept out, untill the Towne were satisfied, wee were
no Enemy, our carriage and Company being great,
frightened them at the first after diner we past through
a long Wood in much danger, and in the view of
Rogues, who did not set upon us because our Com∣pany
was great, yet we fearing the worst, had sent for
a Convoy of Musketiers to the next Towne before,
who met us not untill we were out of the Wood.


Then wee entered into 
Bergish-land,
 and went by

Keiserswert
 to 
Dusseldorp
 to bed,
 which adjoynes to the

Rhine
 on the left side, where the Duke of 
Neiuburgh
 lay,
who was with his Dutchesse abroad taking the aire,
but espying us comming, returned backe into the
Towne with speed, and sent to have the Ports shut up,
thinking wee had beene some Enemy, but hearing it
was his Excellency was very joyfull, and sent Coaches
for him, to come and suppe with him, and to make his
house his lodging the time he staid, but the next mor∣ning
after breake-fast, perceiving his Excellency would
goe away, had three Coaches waiting at the doore,
into one hee put his Excellency, and us into the rest,
and brought us out of Towne, with a Company of
Horsemen and Foote in Armes, and a Troope of Lan∣ces
going before, and Trumpets sounding about the
Coach, his owne Guard; being thus brought with∣out
the Gates, hee tooke his leave of his Excellency


and returned, and as wee were departing, there went
off great peeces of Ordnance.


Thence neere 
Neusse,
 and then crossed over the

Rhine
 at a little Dorpe called 
Hittorpe,
 into the Territo∣ry
of 
Collein,
 and then to the City where we lay. It is
seated on the right side of the 
Rhine,
 where the Bishop
of 
Mentz
 was, who sent one of his Privie Counsell
to invite his Excellency the next day to diner, he then
sent three of his Coaches for us, and gave his Excel∣lency
very noble entertainement; the first night his
Excellency came, were presented unto him twenty
foure Flaggons of severall kindes of Wine, the next
day twenty eight, and at every Present, there was a
long speech made to his Excellency in Latine by one
that came with the Wine, which came all from the
Magistrates of the City in Flaggons with the City
Armes on them, the Jesuits there have built them a
very stately Church and richly adorned it with gil∣dings
and erected an Altar one of the state liest, I ever
saw, in the City likewise there is a great Church cal∣led
the 
Dome,
 wherein lye the Bodies of three Kings,
called 
The three Kings of Collein,
 which went to wor∣ship
our Saviour, then is there another Church called
Saint 
Ursulas,
 in which lyeth the bones of 1100. Vir∣gins
in places locked up, and Saint 
Ursula
 in a faire
Tombe by them, which came all thither with her for
their Devotion, there is besides a Nunnery and some
English Nunnes there.


Heere we staid a weeke, and the twenty eighth day
wee tooke a Boate drawne with nine horses and went
up the 
Rhine,
 by many Villages pillaged and shot
downe, and many brave Vineyards on Mountaines, a∣long


the Rivers side, passing by 
Bonn
 on the right side,
and seven high 
Burghens
 with old Castles on them,
seated on the other side of the River, and to 
Drachen∣fels

Castle on the left of the 
Rhine,
 against which wee
cast Anchor and lay that night on ship-board, the next
morning earely weighed Anchor, passi
 
 an Island
in which is a Monastery of Nunnes called 
onenwer∣ther,

so on by 
Hammerstein
 Castle by 
Keigrmagen An∣dernach

and 
Ormus
 three Townes on the right side of
the 
Rhine,
 against 
Ormus
 wee cast Anchor and lay on
ship-board.


The next day earely weighed Anchor and went by

Engers
 on the left side, and there begunne 
Trierisch∣landt,

and so to 
Coblentz
 a Towne adjoyning to the

Rhine
 on the right side,
 which the French lately lost,
being driven out by the Emperours Forces into a Ca∣stle
seated on a very high Rocke, opposite to the
Towne called 
Hermanstein,
 which commandeth the
Towne, who were then skirmishing when wee came,
wherefore wee cast Anchor about halfe an English
mile before, and sent a Trumpeter desiring passage,
which they willingly granted, ceasing their fight on
both sides, the Generall in the Towne making prepa∣ration
to entertaine his Excellency, did but open the
Gate, thinking to cleare the passage for his Excellen∣cies
entrance, presently they in the Castle let flye a
Cannon and were like to have slaine some of them,
wherefore they withdrew from shewing of them∣selves,
untill his Excellency came against the Gate,
and then came forth and intreated his Excellency to
dine with him, but hee staid not having a long way to
goe that night; they in the Castle are besieged on


every side, before them are Cannons placed just by
the Rivers side, behinde them are a great company of
Horsemen called 
Crabbats,
 beyond them in a plaine
great field, are other Horsemen and Footemen, and
likewise in Islands in the 
Rhine,
 all watching that they
cannot be relieved, they in the Towne, if they doe but
looke out of their windowes, have a bullet presently
presented at their heads, yet the Towne is somewhat
the stronger for a River called the 
Mosell,
 which run∣neth
along one side of the Towne into the 
Rhine,
 over
which there did stand a faire Bridge, though part of
it now be beaten downe, that there is no passage over,
but have made a little lower on the 
Mossell
 a passage
on Boates, to relieve the Towne, under the Castle
there is a very beautifull house, which the 
Emperour

gave to the 
Elector
 of 
Tryer,
 and hee resigned it to the

French,
 whereupon the 
Spaniard
 besieged him, when
he lay in a faire Castle on the 
Mossell
 called 
Tryer,

and tooke him prisoner, and is prisoner now: as wee
were departing from hence, the 
French
 gave us a brave
vollie of shot as hath beene heard, with foure or five
peeces of Ordnance, from hence up the 
Rhine,
 by

Lonstein
 and 
Branbach
 two Townes on the left side, and

Capelle
 a Castle on a Rocke on the other side, to 
Boppart

a Towne on the same side, against which wee cast An∣chor
and lay aboard.


The first of May being Sunday, and their Whit-sunday,
we departed, passing by Villages shot downe,
and by many pictures of our Saviour and the 
Virgin
Mary,
 set up at the turnings of the water, untill we
entered the Land of 
Hesse,
 where we still viewed plea∣sant
Vines on the Mountaines, so by 
Saint Goware,
 and


by 
Rhinefilds
 Castle both on the right side, to 
Catze∣nelbogon

Castle on the other side, then by 
Oberwesell

on the right side; then begins the 
Lower Palatinate,

so by 
Caub
 on the left side, which is the first Towne
in the 
Pfaltz,
 and so to 
Pfaltz
 Castle, seated in a little
Iland in the River,
 from hence to 
Bacharach,
 a Towne
where we landed, it is seated on the right side of the

Rhine,
 having a Castle on a high Rocke within the
walls, and under that a Church, which is from the
plaine ground 100. steps before one can come into it,
heere the poore people are found dead with grasse in
their mouthes: from hence by a Village on the same
side, in which none but Leapers are, being not farre
off the Towne, and so to 
Hambach
 on the same side,
by 
Drechshausen
 on the other side, to 
Armanshausen,

a Towne on the left side of the 
Rhine,
 against which
we cast Anchor and lay on Ship-board.


The next morning departed hence, and then be∣gun

Momtzistzland,
 so by a little Tower in the wa∣ter,
called 
Mouse Thour,
 which one 
Otto
 a Bishoppe
of 
Mentz,
 having lived not well, being much troub∣led
with Mice, built this, and lived in it, thinking there
to be secure, but even thither they pursued him also,
and eate him up: then by 
Bingen,
 a faire Towne on
the right side, and by 
Ehrenfels
 Castle on the other side
to 
Rudeshein,
 a Towne on the left side of the 
Rhine,
 in∣to
which I entered, and did see poore people praying
where dead bones were in a little old house, and
here his Excellencie gave some reliefe to the poore
which were almost starved as it appeared by the vio∣lence
they used to get it from one another: from
hence by 
Geisenhem, Elfeld,
 and 
Wallaff,
 three Townes


on the left side of the River, and then we crossed over
the 
Rhine,
 unto the other side.


Then to 
Mentz
 a great City seated close by the

Rhine
 on the right side against which wee cast Anchor
and lay on ship-board,
 for there was nothing in the
Towne to relieve us, since it was taken by the 
King of
Sweden,
 and miserably battered, there the 
King of Bo∣hemia

dyed, in a faire corner house towards the Ri∣vers
side, heere likewise the poore people were almost
starved, and those that could relieve others before,
now humbly begged to bee relieved, and after supper
all had reliefe, sent from the Ship ashore, at the sight
of which they strove so violently, that some of them
fell into the 
Rhine
 and were like to have bin drowned.


The next day being the third of 
May,
 from hence
wee departed, leaving the 
Rhine
 halfe a league above
the City on our right hand, and entered into a shal∣low
River called the 
Maine,
 passing by a place which
the King of 
Sweden
 was building for a Fort, but could
not finish it, then by 
Cassell,
 on the left side, thence by

Flersheim
 on the left side to 
Russelsheim
 on the right
of the 
Maine,
 and then to the stately City of 
Franc∣furt,

adjacent to the 
Maine
 on the left side, where we
landed and lay: from 
Collein
 hither, all the Townes,
Villages, and Castles bee battered, pillaged or burnt,
and every place wee lay at on the 
Rhine
 on ship-board,
we watched, taking every man his turne; heere wee
staid foure daies, untill our carriages were made ready:
where we saw the place wherein they keepe the 
Dyet,

afterward entered into the Church called Saint 
Bar∣tholmews,

where the 
Emperours
 use to bee crowned and
take their oath; the City is inhabited with 
Lutherans



and 
Iewes,
 for in the 
Iewes Synagogue,
 I entered in to see
the manner of their service, which is an undecent way,
making a hideous noise, having on their heads and a∣bout
their neckes things called 
Capouchins,
 the women
are not admitted into their 
Synagogue,
 but in places a∣bout.
And on Sunday the seventh of 
May,
 by waggons
through the City over two Bridges which are alwaies
guarded with Souldiers, leaving the 
Maine
 on our left
hand, from hence we tooke a Convoy of Musketiers a∣long,
being wee went through much danger, by 
Offen∣bach,
Selgenstat,
 seated betweene us and the 
Maine,

passing thus along through a great Forest in much dan∣ger,
hearing the great Peeces so swiftly discharge off
at 
Hannaw,
 which the 
Swedes
 subdu'd, and now besieged
by the Emperors Forces, being not above three Eng∣lish
miles off, then by a very great Mountaine two Eng∣lish
miles long, all beset with Vines, untill we came at
a poore little Village where wee staid and dined with
provision of our owne, and after dinner departed, pas∣sing
through Plaines untill wee came at the 
Maine,
 and
there ferried over into a towne called 
Klingenberg,
 pas∣sing
through this, we came to a very high hill the way
up being all stone & 2. English miles up to the top, and
then through a Wood, after we were past this, we came
to a poore little Village called 
Neunkirchen,
 where we
found one house a burning when we came and not any
body in the Village, heere we were constrained to tarry
all night, for it grew very late, and no Towne neere
by 4. English miles, spending the night in walking up
and downe in feare, with Carrabines in our hands, be∣cause
we heard Peeces discharg'd off in Woods about
us, and with part of the coles of the consumed house


his Excellency had his meat rosted for supper, the next
morning earely, his Excellency went to view the
Church, which we found rifled with the pictures and
Altars abused, in the Church-yard, we saw a dead bo∣dy
scraped out of the grave, in another place out of the
Church-yard, there lay another dead body, into many
of the houses wee entered, and found them all empty.
From this miserable place we departed, and heard after,
that they in the Village fled by reason of the sicknesse,
and set that house on fire at their departure, that Pas∣sengers
might not be infected.


Then came we into 
Wijrtzburg-land,
 and descended
downe another steep hill and there crossed over a little
River call'd 
Tauber,
 and through 
Keichelsheim,
 to 
Neu∣bruim

a poore Village where wee dined, after dinner
passing by the side of the 
Maine,
 and through Woods
and Plaines,
 untill we came to 
Wijrtzburg,
 a faire City
passing over a bridge first, standing over the 
Maine
 into
the Towne, seated on the left side of the River, and a
faire Castle opposite to the Towne on the other side,
in which the Towne put all their riches when they
heard the king of 
Sweden
 was comming, thinking there
it would not be gain'd, but they hearing of it, surprised
and pillaged it in 3. daies, and it was 3. or 4. moneths be∣fore
the 
Emperors
 forces could regaine it, the next day
earely departed, being the 10. of 
May,
 and entered

Marggrafen-land,
 and to 
Kiteingen
 to diner, after diner,
thence through 
Ipza
 a City,
 and so to 
Marckbibrach,

where we lay all night on the plancher, for the Village
was pillaged but the day before, earely the next mor∣ning
wee went away and passed through 
Neustadt,

which hath beene a faire City, though now pillaged


and burnt miserably, heere we saw poore children sit∣ting
at their doores almost strav'd to death, to whom
his Excellency gave order for to relieve them with
meat and money to their Parents, from hence we went
to Eilfkirchen a poore Village where wee dined, with
some reserv'd meat of our owne, for there was not any
thing to be found, after diner, thence we passed by ma∣ny
Villages pillag'd and burnt down, and so into 
Nurn∣berger-land,

passing through the place where the King
of 
Swedens
 Leaguer lay, when the King of 
Bohemia
 was
with him and my Lord 
Craven,
 and in sight of the place
the 
Emperors
 Army had intrenched themselves by the
side of a great wood, here the 
King of Sweden
 set upon
poles alive three of his souldiers, for killing 2. of their
Commanders, and flying presently to his Enemy, and
at the end of a Battaile that was then fought, he tooke
them prisoners, and so executed them, then drawing
neere 
Nurnburg
 a great City seated in a Plaine,
 which
the 
King of Sweden
 relieved at that time against the 
Em∣peror,

being not above two English miles off, heere we
passed by some of their workes before the Towne, and
then entered the Gate into the City being very stately
built, and one of the strongest in 
Germany,
 and so to his
Excellencies lodging, the next day the Lords of the
City came and visited his Excellency; here we staid II
daies untill his Excellency had word for certain where
the Emperor was, the most part of our time was spent
in seeing of the rare things in the Towne, as a very
brave 
Magazine
 wherein all their munition lieth, which
the Governours of the towne shewed his Excellency,
at our first entrance wee passed through a large Court
where there lay on our left hand 4. great Cannons by


the walles side, which were 6. paces long, and 2. foote
broad, and worke-houses there likewise, then entered
we into a long roome where there hung on both sides
armour for foot and horse, and then into the place it selfe,
where there were 6. partitions each 28. paces long and
6. broad, all full of brasse Peeces and other small ones
of severall rare inventions, from hence we went to see
a very rare water-worke which supplieth all the City,
adjoyning close to the wall of the Towne, returning
homewards, we entered into their great Church call'd
the 
Dome,
 there his Excellency was shewed a very state∣ly
picture of the 
Annunciation of the Virgin Mary,
 which
hung in the middle of the Quire, drawne up, which had
not bin shewed to any in 18. yeeres before, and then re∣turn'd
home, and the Lords with him, who supped with
his Excellency, the next day they dined with him like∣wise,
and after diner desired his Excellency to goe and
take the aire in some of their Gardens without the Ci∣ty,
which he did: the City is very strong being encom∣passed
without the wals with bulwarkes and a mighty
deepe and wide ditch, and within are many curiosities
and stately buildings: the ancient men (called 
Lords
)
governe by turnes, not acknowledging any particular
Prince their Soveraigne, but hold correspondency with
all, for in the time of those great wars between the 
Em∣peror

and the 
King of Sweden,
 they would resigne to the

Emperor
 one while, and to the 
K.
 another, paying great
taxes & impositions to their halfe undoing. Frō hence
we departed May 22. being Sunday, for 
Regenspurgh,

thinking there to meete with the 
Emperor,
 first p
ssing
through a part of the upper 
Palatinate
 to 
Newmark,

where we lay, seated in a plaine where the king of 
Bo∣hemia



had a house, which his Excellency viewed, ad∣joyning
to the wall within the Towne, fortified with
bulwarkes and pallizadoes, having spacious roomes and
a faire Armory: early the next morning, from hence, by
Churches demolished to the ground, and through
Woods in danger, understanding that Crabbats were
lying heere about, untill we came at a poore little Vil∣lage
called 
Hemmaw
 where we staied and dined, which
hath beene pillaged eight and twenty times in two
yeeres, and twice in one day, and they have there no
water but that which they save when it raineth: after
dinner, to 
Ettershansen
 a poore Village where we cross∣ed
over a little River in Boates, the Bridge being
burnt downe by the 
Swedes
 forces; from hence wee
ascended up a high hill, being descended downe, wee
passed a long on an high banke, having the River 
Da∣nubius

on our right hand, and high Mountaines with
Vines on our left, passing thus through severall Villa∣ges
beaten downe or burnt, untill we came at a round
Fort before the Bridge which a guard kept, and so o∣ver
it through a Tower in the middle standing over
the 
Danuby,
 which runneth with as swift a current as at

London
 Bridge, dividing it selfe into severall Ilands
which have had howses on them, but now burnt, and
also houses on the Arches which were demolished
likewise,
 then into the Citie 
Regenspurg
 to his Excel∣lencies
lodging, the Citie hath bin taken by the 
Swedish

forces, and regained by the King of 
Hungary.


The 25. day his Excellency went to take the ayre on
the other side of the Towne, and as we went did see
the ruines of many houses and Churches, and one 
Car∣thusian

Monastery not so much ruinated as the rest, in∣to


which his Excellency entered to see the roomes
wherein the King of 
Hungary
 did lie all the time hee
was regaining of the Citie, being not above two Eng∣lish
miles off it, and heere likewise the old Duke of 
Ba∣varia,

this Dukes Father lived in a Cell for many yeers
together, againe his Excellency went to take the ayre
the 28. day, and entered into a Jesuites Monastery, in
which there is one Altar dedicated to S. 
George;
 here
his Excellency staied a weeke, and departed thence
for 
Liniz,
 where the Emperour was, taking foure
Boates and went downe the 
Danow
 thorough 
Bavaria,

passing by a Castle called 
Donastauff,
 seated on a high
Mountaine, with a Dorpe at the foote of it, adjoyning
to the 
Danubij
 on the left side, and by 
Werth
 Castle on
the same side,
 to 
Straubingen
 on the same side where we
landed about eleuen at night and lay that night; the
next morning from thence, still by many ruines to 
Po∣gen

on the right side, at the foote of a very high Moun∣taine,
and on the top of it a Church with a few houses
about it; then by 
Nuternberg
 Castle seated on a high
Mountaine on the right side of the River, and by 
Deck∣endorff

on the other side, against which wee met with
thirty horses fastened all to one rope drawing of sixe
great boats which were going to 
Regenspurg,
 then by a
Castle called 
Tawrin
 seated on a high Mountaine, and
below at the bottome is a Towne walled round, called

Overwinter
 on the left side,
 and so to 
Vilshoven,
 a towne
on the right of the 
Danuby
 where wee landed and lay
that night. The next morning as his Excellency was
taking Boate, he spied a poore Boy standing among o∣ther
poore people begging for reliefe, who looked ve∣ry
strangely and could neither speake nor heare, but a


little at his mouth and nose, having neither eares nor
passage to heare with, and his face very thin & drawne
aside, yet when one hallowed hee heard and answered
againe with a noise, there was with him his sister, a pret∣ty
girle, who when one spake to him, made him under∣stand
by signes, these two his Excellency tooke along
with him in his Boate to a City called 
Passaw
 seated on
the right side of the 
Danuby,
 where we landed & lay,
and there common ded to have new clothes made for
them & gave them monie and sent them home to their
freinds, and a little before we came thither, endeth 
Ba∣varia;

this Citie is seated very sweetly, having 3. rivers
running neere it, the 
Danuby
 which is of a green color,
incompasseth it of one side, and a swift river called 
Inn,

on the other side, which commeth out of 
Italy,
 and is
of a white color, the third is 
Ilze,
 which is very blacke,
and commeth out of 
Bohemia,
 and both runne into the

Danuby
 at the end of the towne, the next day his Ex∣cellency
went to view a 
Capuchine
 Monastery, seated
very pleasantly on a high hill, neere unto the Towne,
first we passed over a bridge made of little rafts which
standeth over the river 
Inn,
 and so through 
Instadt,
 and
then ascended up the hill upon which the Monastery
stands, and then entered into the Chappell called our

Ladies Chappell,
 being built in the yeere 1636. where
we saw a neat Altar, and a picture of the 
Virgin Maries

set up in the Altar, and many fine reliques, left there
of those that are said to have been healed of severall
diseases, comming but thither to doe their Devotion,
and returned thence sound, from hence we descended
to another Chappell at the bottome of the hill, passing
downe 274. steps, being set in order, 10. and 11. toge∣ther.


and as much plaine ground as containeth the steps
thorow out the whole descent, and in the middle of
the descent is a Crucifix, at which one daily sits to re∣ceive
the almes of charitable people, which Cruci∣fix
one rude person passing by, strucke it, and fell
downe dead and never revived, as these 
Capuchines
 re∣lated,
and then returned. And opposite to the citie
on the other side of the 
Danuby
 on a very high rocke, is
seated a strong Castle which cannot be scaled, called

Festingoverhouse,
 commanding all the Townes and Mo∣nasteries;
at the foot of this is another strong built
Fort, by which the river 
Ilze
 falleth into the 
Da∣nuby,

betweene the towne 
Ilze
 and this: the citie is
governed by 
Leopoldus
 the Emperours second sonne,
who is Bishop of it; here we stayed three dayes, and
departed the fourth of Iune, and entred into upper

Austria,
 passing by 
Schaumberg
 castle on the left side of
the river, and by 
Effertingen
 on the other side, and

Wilhering
 Monastery on the same side,
 to 
Lintz
 where
the Emperour was, who sent to receive his Excellence
at his landing the Count of 
Harrack,
 Marshall of
the Court, with some other Courtiers; after his gra∣tulation
with his Excellence, there came ten or twelve
coaches, which waited on his Excellence to his lodg∣ing
which the Emperour had provided, and then re∣turned.
Presently after came the Count 
Megaw,
 high
Steward to the Emperour, to visit his Excellence; and
the next day Count 
Mansfelt
 Captaine of the Foot-Guard
to visit his Excellence, and after him Father

Lemmarman,
 his Majesties Confessour.


The sixth of Iune, being the second day after wee
came, his Excellence had audience of the Emperour


and Empresse, who sent their coaches for us; being
come to his palace, which is seated on a hill, we went
up foure ascents of staires, the Guard standing on each
side of us, with halberds and carrabines in their hands,
passing thus thorow roomes, untill wee came at the
doore of the chamber in which the Emperour was,
and when his Excellence came at the doore, out came
the little Count of 
Kezell,
 high Chamberlaine to his
Majestie, and brought in his Excellence, and then
withdrew and shut the doore after him, that none
might enter in: after his Excellence had beene within
a while, we were all admitted, and kissed his Majesties
hand, and then withdrew, and passed thorow other
roomes and a gallerie, where the Guard stood in like
manner, to the Empresses chamber, where none
might enter neither, stealing a sight of her as wee
stood, and then returned.


The eighth day his Excellence had his second au∣dience
of the Emperour, as private as the first: and
the tenth day audience againe of the Empresse, and
then wee were admitted to kisse her hand: the same
day there were seven men beheaded which were Re∣bels,
for rising up in armes with foure hundred other
Boores against the Emperour: the first that was exe∣cuted,
was said to be one that had inchanted himselfe,
that no bullet could hurt him, and the onely seducer
of the others: after he was upon the scaffold and his
face covered, two men held him fast to the blocke,
then came the Executioner with a red hot paire of
pincers, and violently clapt hold of both his brests,
that done, nailed his right hand fast to the blocke, and
chopt it off, then presently whipt out his sword from


his side, and cut off his head, one of the hangmen
presently tooke it up, and cryed at the eares of the
head, 
Iesus, Iesus;
 then the Iesuite which came a long
with him admonishing of him, desired everie one to
joyne in prayers with him for him; then came the o∣ther,
and a Boy which was beheaded likewise, all ma∣king
their private confessions to Priests, at the foot of
the scaffold, having a Crucifix in their hand, kissing
their hands & feet at the end of everie prayer: After
all those men were beheaded, and quartered, there
went two of their confederates a foot to bee hanged
about an English mile off, to a place where a Priest of
theirs hung upon a pole, and his head on the top,
which was taken in a Church a yeere before called

Ering,
 which we afterward passed by.


The twelfth day being Sunday, the Emperour, Em∣presse,
and the Arch-Dutchesse, dined at the Iesuites
College; but before, they heard Masse in their Church,
and after dinner a play was presented to them by the
house, and some young schollers, consisting of many
varieties. The fifteenth day his Excellencie dined at
the Count 
Megaws,
 and was nobly entertained: the
sixteenth day as we were at dinner, there came a migh∣tie
clap of thunder and lightning, which burnt downe
three houses presently, being not above an English
mile off, on the other side of the water, and such ac∣cidents
happen here often, by reason all their houses
be covered with thin boord, in the manner of tile;
and about foure of the clocke in the after-noone, his
Excellence had audience the third time, and we all in∣vited
to a 
Balto,
 by the Empresses command, to the
Count 
Slavataes,
 who is Chancellour of 
Prague,
 where










all the Ladies assembled, and there spent the time in
dancing: in 
Moravia
 not farre from this place, there
was a Baron whose name was 
Rabell,
 having a wife,
which couple had beene married fortie yeeres toge∣ther,
and had many children, and when he was eightie
two yeeres old, and his wife seventie five, she concei∣ved
and brought him forth two children at a birth, a
sonne and a daughter, which children lived a yeere
and died, and then presently after their parents both
died, and was buried in S. 
Michaels
 Church, a Church
of the 
Dominicans
 in 
Brune,
 a towne in 
Moravia:
 this
storie was related to us by a Priest of the Empresses
for certaine; here his Excellence stayed nineteene
dayes, and all the time at the Emperours charge, and
served by his Majesties servants, in as much state as he
himselfe; at the first course the Drums beat up, and
at the second, musike with voyces.


From hence we tooke boat for 
Vienna,
 the three and
twentieth day of Iune, passing downe the swift river

Danuby,
 neere the Church called 
Ering,
 wherein the
Boores assembled and chose that Priest, who was ta∣ken
and executed as afore-mentioned, so by a faire ca∣stle
called 
Spiulbarke,
 where the Duke of 
Bavaria
 makes
his Toll-place seated on the left side of the river, then
by 
Markhawsen
 on the same side, by 
Walzig
 a faire ca∣stle
seated on the other side on a high hill, and the
towne at the foot a little beyond, so by another faire
castle called 
Crayne,
 seated on a high rocke close by the

Danuby,
 on the left side, the towne at the foot of it,
both belonging to the Count 
Megaw:
 then thorow a
place in the water called the 
Struddell,
 where it run∣neth
very swift, with a great fall amongst the rockes,


and dangerous to passe, having no more space than the
breadth of a boat, which if it toucheth, breakes into
many peeces, and over this place on a high rocke is a
Crosse set up, having past this danger, just by on the
left side of the River is an old Chappell called S. 
Nico∣las,

out of which came two men with his picture in a
box, to receive an accustomed reward due from those
which passe by safe: from hence by a faire castle cal∣led

Besinboe,
 seated on the same side on a rocke, and by

Pekelem
 on the same side, then by 
Wednick
 castle seated
on a rocke on the left side, with a village beneath it,
so by a castle and monasterie encircled with a wall,
seated on a verie high rocke called 
Milke,
 and the
towne at the foot of the rocke along by the 
Danuby
 on
the right side, part of it burnt by an accident when
the King of 
Hungary
 was in it, and by 
Sable
 castle on a
high rocke on the same side, with a faire banquetting
house, which belongeth to the Grave 
Sturbutz;
 and
a little further on the same side, is another banquet∣ting-house,
called the Devils banquetting-house, by
reason of many apparitions there seene. Then to a
little poore Dorp called 
Aspagh
 on the left side of
the 
Danuby,
 where wee went a shore and lay that
night.


Earely the next morning, being the foure and
twentieth day, we went up the river by a castle called
the 
Spitz,
 seated on the same side, so by 
Stiringsteine,
 a
faire towne on a rocke adjoyning to the river on the
same side, with a ruinated castle over the towne on a
hill, with rocks on both sides, which are the Grave

Van Seldingz:
 then by another faire towne seated on
the same side called 
Stine,
 from which there standeth a


bridge over the 
Danuby
 made of rafts, having thirtie
seven arches, under which wee passed, and at the end
of it, opposite to the towne is a monasterie with ma∣ny
faire houses belonging to it, and behinde this is an∣other
stately built monasterie, called 
Kitne,
 seated on
a hill: from this an English mile distance, with a de∣lightfull
prospect, just by are two other faire townes,
the one 
Crempz,
 and the other 
Winsell,
 seated both on
the left side of the 
Danuby
 in a plaine, which three
townes are within the compasse of an English mile;
then by 
Tolnie
 a towne on the other side, which is the
oldest towne in all the Empire, against which wee lay
a while and dined on ship-boord: after dinner wee
entred into lower 
Austria,
 and went by an old castle
called 
Griffopsteine,
 seated on a rocke on the same side,
in which all Priests that offend are imprisoned and
tried.


Then a Dutch mile further, on the left side, the

Danubius
 runneth out to a faire Towne called 
Corny∣brough,

seated an English mile off in a Plaine with
faire Monasteries therein, then on the other side of
the river is 
Cloysternybrough,
 full of Cloysters and Mo∣nasteries;
so by 
Nustorffe
 on the same side, from
whence we discovered 
Vienna,
 seated in a Plaine, then
left the 
Danu,
 which divides its selfe into sever all bran∣ches
and meet beyond the Towne, and runs thorow

Hungary
 into the blacke Sea, and went up in an arme
of it to the Citie, where wee landed, seated on the
right side of the 
Danu,
 which is very well fortified
round the wals, besides a compleat Regiment of 1500
men alwayes ready in armes, part watching at everie
gate, some about the Emperours palace, others about


the place where the Iewes keep their shops in the Ci∣tie,
for they are not suffered to lye in the Towne a
night, but constrained to keepe within a place on the
other side of the River opposite to the Citie, which
they have built, and is called the Iewes Burg; for if
any one be found all night in the Towne, he is misera∣bly
punished, if not put to death: there are likewise
7000 Burgers in the citie, which are to be in armes at
an houres warning.


The next day being Sunday, his Excellence had au∣dience
of the Queene of 
Hungary
 and the Arch-Duke

Leopoldus,
 the Emperours second sonne, being the 26.
day, and nothing wee saw note-worthy at his palace,
but a spacious Court-yard: the next day againe his
Excellence went to see the Dukes lodging, where we
saw onely a few pictures; from hence he went to se∣verall
houses of the Iesuites, the first was a University,
where was presented to his Excellence a kinde of Co∣medy
by young Schollers in masking attire, and one of
the house playing on an instrument like a Virginall,
severall kindes of musicke; after that, a banquet
brought in by the Actors: this ended, we went to the
second house called the Probation-house, where none
but young men are, about fiftie in number, there to
be tried whether they may bee made capable of holy
orders: thence to the third house, called the Profest-house,
where none but the ancient Fathers are, where
as soon as his Excellence entred, an oration was made
to him by one of the chiefe, & after viewed the house
and Church, in which there was an hymne sung by
their best singers, with very sweet musicke, and they
have an organ of five thousand pipes. From hence


wee returned home to our lodging, where there
came presently after the Prince of 
Ducardins
 to visit
his Excellence.


The eight and twentieth day his Excellence went
to see a garden of the Emperours about a Dutch mile
off, called 
Nigobath,
 upon which place the Turke once
intrenched himselfe, when hee would have taken 
Vi∣enna,

and was then two hundred thousand men strong,
in the Emperour 
Rodolphus
 his time, and after they
were driven out of the countrey, the Emperour built
this on their works for a memoriall, the garden is al∣most
foure-square, encircled with a strong stone wall,
and at every corner a faire Tower, and in the middle
two, with three partitions in everie one, and the tops
covered with brasse, round within the wall is a walke
for two to goe a brest, covered with brasse, and under∣set
thicke with pillars of stone: then returned wee to
another very stately large garden of the Empresses
neere unto the citie, called her 
Favorita,
 having seve∣rall
small gardens adjoyning to it and a faire house:
the next day his Excellence went to see the Queene
againe, and the two Princes her Sonne and Daughter
here we staid a weeke, and departed the first of Iuly
by waggons for 
Prague,
 passing first over three long
bridges handing over severall branches of the 
Danu∣bius:

so by the wals of 
Cornyburgh
 the towne afore∣mentioned,
to 
Stackay
 a poore village where wee di∣ned,
after dinner by 
Kildersdorf
 to 
Holebrum
 a poore
village,
 where wee lay all night on the straw, having
travelled seven Dutch miles, and every Dutch mile
is foure English, where six and twentie houses were
burnt that day fortnight wee came, by thunder and


lightning, the next day early from hence passing tho∣row
plaines and corne-fields which were a reaping,
we came to 
Kudordorp,
 where 
Moravia
 begins in a great
plaine, where two stones are set in the ground, divi∣ding
Lower 
Austria
 and 
Moravia,
 then past we thorow

Colendorp
 the first towne in 
Moravia,
 and by a Crosse
standing in a plaine not neere any towne, with many
graves about it,
 then to 
Swamb
 a prettie towne where
we dined, having past that fore-noone in danger neere
a great company of Crabats, who were thereabouts,
who frighted the towne: for when his Excellencies
Harbenger entred the gates an houre before us, they
were all shutting up of their shops, and running out
to defend the towne. After dinner thorow most
plaines and corne-fields which were a reaping, untill
wee came at 
Bodewich,
 a poore village,
 where wee lay
on the plancher, and travelled that day seven Dutch
miles.


The next day being Sunday, and the third of Iuly,
we stayed there untill dinner, and thence thorow
part of a wood called 
Hertz-waldt,
 on a causey two En∣glish
miles long, the wood being three hundred miles
in length (as we were credibly informed) passing tho∣row
we saw severall fires in it, & many strange things
are likewise seene, and so by 
Bernetz,
 a little towne at
the end of the wood, to 
Iglo,
 a beautifull built towne
seated on a little hill, where we lay that night, having
gone foure Dutch miles and an halfe. Earely the next
morning from thence passing over a River at the end
of the towne, which parteth 
Moravia
 and 
Bohemia,
 and
then thorow 
Stickey
 the first towne in 
Bohemia,
 so tho∣row

Haybeireitz
 a village, in which an Oast killed at se∣verall


times of his guests ninetie men, and made meat
of them, so to 
Dutchbrade
 a towne where wee dined,
and then departed, passing thorow a plaine wooddie
countrey to 
Holebrum,
 where we lay that night on the
plancher, which was a most fearefull night of thunder
and lightning, having travelled seven Dutch miles.


The next morning wee departed, and went tho∣row
a wooddie countrey againe, and thorow a towne
called 
Shasshaw
 where in the street we passed thorow,

lieth buried the body of one 
Iohn Ziska,
 who made
war against the Emperour 
Rodolphus,
 in the defence of
his deere friend 
Iohn Hus,
 who died a Martyr: this

Iohn Ziska
 in all his wars was a victor, and when hee
was blinde desired to bee carried up and downe the
wars, and at his death commanded that a Drum might
be made of his skin, which was done, and whereso∣ever
that was, they subdued likewise; then by a silver
Mine of the King of 
Hungaries,
 which was by the way
side on a little hill, into which wee entred to see their
works, the oare being two hundred and fiftie fathom
deepe, and behinde this place is a citie called 
Ketten∣burgh,

which wee left two English miles of our left
hand and thence to 
Colen
 two English miles off like∣wise
where we dined; about part of the towne runs
the River 
Elbe:
 after dinner we past thorow a plaine
countrey to 
Bemishbrade,
 where wee lay on the plan∣cher
againe, having travelled eight Dutch miles,
which hath beene a faire built towne, and very plea∣santly
seated, but now burnt almost downe by a Car∣penter,
when the Emperour was in it, and since been
pillaged twice, by the Swedish, and the Duke of 
Ba∣varia

his forces.



The next morning earely, being the sixth of Iuly,
from thence to 
Prague
 to dinner,
 being five Dutch
miles, passing first thorow very pleasant plaines and
meddowes, vntill we came neere the citie, which is en∣compassed
on both sides with rocks and hils, all plan∣ted
with vines, having three townes belonging to it,

Newstadt, Oldstadt,
 and the 
Slostadt;
 at 
Newstadt
 wee
entred in at a faire gate, passing thorow into 
Oldstadt,

to his Excellencies lodging, which said 
Stadt
 is inha∣bited
chiefly by Iewes, who have there foure Syna∣gogues,
and in one I saw there a Rabbi circumcise a
child, here we were told that all their fruits in the fur∣ther
parts of the countrey were spoyled, as corne,
vineyards, and the like, by the aforesaid thunder and
lightning with hailestones as big as ones fist, and also
divers cattell were then lost: between this and the

Slostadt
 runneth a pleasant river called the 
Muldow,
 and
over it standeth a faire Bridge of stone, as long as 
Lon∣don

Bridge, over which his Excellencie passed, going
to view the Castle, being a stately large built Fort,
seated on a high hill within the 
Slostadt,
 called 
Ketschin,

in which the King of 
Bohemia
 lived▪ first wee passed
thorow three faire Court-yards, having at one of the
gates a guard of Souldiers in which Court-yard there
is a statue of S. 
George
 on horse-backe in brasse, and a
fountaine, then entred we into a spacious hall, having
many faire shops in it like unto 
Westminster,
 but that
their Courts of Iudicature are in other roomes by it:
from hence wee went up and passed thorow many
faire roomes well hung, and pictures in them, and one
roome furnished with English pictures of our Nobili∣tie,
which the King of 
Bohemia
 was forced to leave,


passing thus untill wee came at one roome two stories
high, which was their Councell-chamber, where the

Bohemians
 being sat at Councell, and three of the Em∣perours
Couucell with them, there rose a mutiny, in∣somuch
that they threw them three out on the
ground, which was fiftie five foot high, and shot pi∣stols
after them, yet none of them killed, and two of
them still alive, and upon that ground they fell on are
set set up three gilt crosses: then went we downe in∣to
a stately lower roome, which used to bee their mas∣king
roome, upholden with severall faire pillars, in the
middle, and statures of brasse placed by them; by the
wals hang pictures of Indian horses which were there
then; adjoyning to this is a large dining roome, ha∣ving
a table in it of Mozaique worke, and musicke
within it not to be discerned, then at the end of this
roome is a little place where choyce armour is, and
one Piece which I saw shot off a bullet, not having any
powder in it: then into the 
Schaut kamber,
 where the
treasure was, and a most noble collection of the Em∣perour

Rodolphus.


In the first roome was cup-boords placed in the
wals on our right hand; the first was of corall; the
second, of Purslaine; the third, of mother of pearle;
the fourth, of curious brasse-plates engraven; the fifth
and sixth. Mathematicall Instruments; the seventh,
Basons, Ewers, and cups of Amber; the eighth, cups
of Aggets, Gold and Chrystall; the ninth of rocks;
the tenth, of Mozaique worke in stone; the eleventh,
cups of Ivorie, and a great Unicornes horne a yard in
length; the twelfth, of imbossing worke; the thir∣teenth,
of Brasse pictures; the foureteenth, of antick


things cast in silver; the fifteenth, cabinets of 
Bohemia

Diamonds, and little chests of 
Bohemia
 pearle; the
sixteenth, things belonging to Astronomy; the se∣venteenth
and eighteenth, Indian worke; the nine∣teenth,
Turkey-worke; the twentieth, of a lively
statue of a woman covered with taffatie. Then in the
middle of the roome are rare clocks of all kinds; the
first was like a globe with musike; the second was set
round about the middle with little pillars, and a bullet
running round in a cresse out and in, and over it hung
two little cords, which being puld, wee heard sweet
musike, but could not discerne from whence it was;
the third had a faire lively face and hand looking out,
and musike with voyces singing, not to be discovered;
the fourth, a close clocke, and by it a faire table of Mo∣zaique
worke; the fifth, with foure ascents set seve∣rally
with pillars, and a bullet running round in a
cresse up to the top, playing with musike; the sixth,
like the top of a globe, the gold coloured like a green
field, and a Bucke running round in and out, and
hounds after making a noyse, and beneath musike, and
Anticks, dancing in a round within it; the seventh, a
clocke with a globe: by the wals on the other side an∣ticke
things set up, and pictures, together with a steele
chaire very curiously wrought and cut thorow. Then
entred wee into another little closet, wherein were
more cabbins placed in the wals on the same side, of
presents sent to the Emperour, as gilt helmets and
head peeces, and statues.


In the third roome, foure cup-boords in the wals
full of rare pictures, and in the middle of the roome
anticke things, as a Bore rough cast to the life, and a


statue of a strong Maid to the life, who went to war,
and a presse of ancient bookes. The fourth roome,
three cup-boords full of the Anatomies of severall
rarities, as Cockatrices, and fishes part resembling
men; and the fourth cup-boord of rare great shels;
the fifth, of fine dishes; the sixth, of all kinde of little
shels, and a Librarie, with one mightie great booke 
in
folio,
 written by a Fryar in a dungeon, who was there
put in, upon some hainous offence there to suffer, and
fortie yeeres after discovered by some Fryars going
neere, hearing a noyse, had search made, and found
him, who brought forth this booke, consisting of the
old and new Testament, and many strange histories,
which hee was all that time a writing, and assisted by
the Devill (as he conceived) and spake very little more
before he died.


Here is likewise all the skins of those Indian horses,
whose pictures hung up in the masking roome: then
did wee enter into a large Church, standing neere a∣bout
the middle of the Castle, where about the Quire
are cut in wood many fine things, and a tombe of the
Queenes Confessour, called 
Iohan. Nepomews,
 who was
miserably tortured by 
Wenceslaus
 the fourth King of

Bohemia,
 to reveale her Majesties confession, and at
last put to death by him, 
Anno Dom.
 1383, from hence
his Excellencie went to view a garden behind the ca∣stle
within the wall, where wee went in a walke cove∣red
arbour-like, halfe an English mile long, untill we
came at a stately old building, with walkes round the
house, and set thicke with pillars and likewise on the
top of the house, with a delightfull prospect over all
the citie, and then his Excellencie returned backe to


the Keepers house, and there dined, having sent pro∣vision
before: dinner being past, his Excellencie went
to see a Parke two English miles off the Citie, in which
there is a Friarie of white Friars, who were leaping
then in the Parke, as wee passed by to see a great beast
called a Buffule, which is kept there, and then retur∣ned
home by 
Wallensteines
 new house, into which his
Excellencie entred to view it, first passing thorow a
large hall of eight and thirtie paces, or more in length,
and one and twentie in breadth, we went up thorow
galleries having pictures hung up, and painted on the
wals with stories of 
Hercules,
 above head divers stories
of 
Ovid;
 then to the Audience-roome, where the
foure elements are in the middle above head, and tho∣row
other faire chambers; then downe into the gar∣den,
where there are five fountaines, and great figures
of brasse placed on them, and on the great fountaine

Neptune,
 with foure Nymphs about him, and a faire

Grott-house,
 but the waters run not; then into the sta∣ble,
being curiously built, where six and twentie hor∣ses
may stand, the pillars and manger all of red mar∣ble,
and thirtie eight in number, and each pillar cost
twentie five pounds, there are foure Court-yards
which encompasseth the house, which is now the
King of 
Hungaries.


This 
Wallensteine
 was sole Commander of the Em∣pire,
under the Emperour, and grew so great, which
caused his Majestie to be jealous of him, as he had just
cause considering his plots which hee had laid against
the Crowne; but to prevent the worst, privately
tooke order with some of his Irish Captaines, who
were appointed to keepe watch of him that night, to


cut him off, which was effected in the evening, pres∣sing
on the sudden into his chamber found him onely
in his shirt, and said, 
Live Ferdinando, but dye traytour
Wallensteine;
 at which he opened his armes and cried,

Oh my God,
 embracing the stabs of the halberds, which
done, they cut off his head, and presently posted to
the Emperour with it, who gave them great rewards,
and they still continue much in his favour.


The next day his Excellence was invited to a play
at the Iesuites College, where the 
Senior
 of the house
is an Irish man, and there entertained Prince-like;
first, an oration by a young Scholler, then passing
downe by a Guard of Souldiers, who discharged their
muskets: his Excellence being past to the roome
where the Comedy was acted, which action did please
exceedingly, not onely in respect of substance, but
also for the goodnesse of the action and severall ha∣bits,
in number more than fiftie, the chiefe part were
young Schollers, and divers of them Barons sons, and
being ended, desired to kisse his Excellencies hand
kneeling, in testimony of his approbation. And here
is the argument annexed in the page following.

Here we stayed seven dayes, and departed the thir∣teenth
of Iuly for 
Regenspurg
 by waggons, over the
plaine where the great battell was fought, betweene
the Emperour and the King of 
Bohemia,
 not above two
English miles from the citie, there wee did observe
many places in the ground, wherein the dead bodies
were put, and a great company of bones lying by on a
heape, where were slaine in all on both sides about
thirtie thousand: from thence thorow a plaine corne
countrey, to a little towne three Dutch miles from

Frague,
 called 
Beroum,
 where wee lay, which towne
hath beene burnt by the Duke of 
Saxon
 his forces.
The next morning earely wee went thorow plaine
corne-fields and meddowes, untill we came to 
Mauth,

a poore village where we dined: from thence thorow
woods, and by poore villages burnt, to a prettie
towne called 
Pilsen,
 where we lay that night, having
travelled seven Dutch miles, it is seated in a plaine,


with three little rivers running by it, as 
Misen, Glatow,

and 
Pilsen,
 taking the name from the towne.


The next morning thorow a wooddie countrey
and corne-fields to 
Swabe
 to dinner; after dinner to

Bishopsteine
 to bed,
 having this day travelled but foure
Dutch miles, in which the Count 
Dorfmastaff
 hath a
little castle pleasantly seated, and the river 
Igree
 run∣ning
about part of it, the towne was never pillaged as
yet. Earely the next morning from thence passing
thorow a very stony hill, and a wood foure English
miles in length, called 
Bemer-waldt,
 wherein about the
middest there is a 
Schans,
 in which Count 
Mansfelt
 and
his Armie lay two moneths, at which 
Schans
 the upper

Palatinate
 begins. Then to 
Waldminiken,
 a little towne
to dinner, the first in the upper 
Palatinate;
 and the
Oast of the house did serve Count 
Mansfelt
 as Anci∣ent
at that time: after dinner thorow a wooddie
poore countrey to 
Redtz
 a little towne where we lay
that night, having travelled six Dutch miles.


The seventeenth day being Sunday, early we depar∣ted,
passing thorow great woods, in danger of the
Crabats lying thereabouts, and carried out of our
way by by chance through an ignorant guide, untill
we came to 
Bruke,
 a towne miserably ruinated, seated
pleasantly in a plaine, where there was not above
foure poore housholds remaining: not long since it
was in great prosperitie; for when wee were a little
past the towne, there was a gallowes and scaffold by
the way, whereon the Burgers of the towne suffered,
and many hanging still, who were 
Lutherans:
 then to
a towne called 
Nettenow
 to dinner, and from thence
after dinner to 
Regenspurg,
 having travelled se∣ven


Dutch miles this day, passing first thorow many
pleasant places of landskips, and over the river 
Regen,

(which runneth into the 
Danuby
 just by the citie) pas∣sing
over on rafters, the bridge being beaten downe
then with the other former batteries: between 
Vienna

and this place, are many faire built townes promising
much, by reason of their severall 
Piazzo's,
 or Market-places
and Fountaines, with other such expressions,
but entring the houses, scarse finde men, lodging, or
people of understanding to exchange discourse with.
The next day after his Excellence came hither,
 the
Ambassadour of the Elector of 
Brandenburg
 visited
him; and the day after his Excellence visited him a∣gaine;
here his Excellence stayed but foure dayes,
because the Emperour was not come, and departed
for 
Augusta,
 on Thursday the one and twentieth of
Iuly, and dined that day at 
Sall,
 a small towne on the

Danuby,
 thence thorow 
Bavaria
 to 
Augsburg,
 a verie
fine towne standing on the river 
Volga,
 which a little
before fals into the 
Danuby,
 and thence that night to

Neistadt,
 a faire towne ten miles from 
Regenspurg,

where his Excellence lay that night.


Next day earely passing thorow a fine wooddie
countrey to 
Bezanzon,
 where my Lady Abbesse gave
his Excellence a banquet, from thence after dinner to

Palermo,
 a stately towne,
 and there lay that night, ha∣ving
travelled seven Dutch miles. Satturday being
the three and twentieth of Iuly, we departed for 
Au∣gusta,

passing thorow part of 
Tiroll
 to 
Mumantia,
 burnt
some two yeeres since by Generall 
Cleandor,
 one of the
King of 
Swedens
 Colonels; and from thence to 
Dole,

which hath been a verie pleasant situated towne, stan∣ding


on the brow of a hill, from whence at the di∣stance
of three English miles we beheld 
Augusta,
 which
towne of 
Dole
 was also with 
Bezanzow
 burnt by Colo∣nell

Cleandor
 two yeeres since, passing thorow this
towne, we descended into a goodly valley, but ere we
gut into it, went over a small arme of the river 
Tanais,

(which encompasseth 
Augusta
 on the West, as the ri∣ver

Vindilicorum
 doth on the East) passing this valley,
which is the more famous, in respect at the upper end
of it was fought the great battell of 
Pharsalia,
 between

Pompey
 & 
Iulius Caesar,
 from whence it takes the name
of the Plaine of 
Pharsalia:
 drawing neere 
Augusta,
 we
passed over five bridges standing over the river 
Vindi∣licorum,

which is divided into so many branches so
running with so many Bulwarks: the river water is of
an excellent greene colour, which is caused (as they
say) running out of Copperas mines, which are in
the mountaines of 
Dalmatia,
 from whence it springs,
taking its name from 
Vindix
 a famous Captaine, who
first rebelled against 
Nero,
 passing over all these brid∣ges,
we entred the outer towne, which is well built,
and so in at a broad port thorow the high street to his
Excellences lodging, that day and the next was spent
in seeing pictures: Munday being the five and twen∣tieth
day, his Excellence went to see the Stadt-house.
First you must understand it to bee a square pile, of
at least one hundred foot square; in the middest a∣gainst
the street, yee enter by a large paire of staires
of thirteene steps, into a stately lower roome suppor∣ted
by twelve Calcidonian pillars, opposite to which
against the wals stand the images of the first 
Cae∣sars,

which because they were written under,



I will mention as first, 
Augustus
 the City Foun∣der,
from whence it takes the name, then 
Tiberi∣us,
Nero, Sergius, Andronicus, Meleager, The∣mistocles,
Lysimachus, Orion; Phoebus, Enobarbus,
 and

Barbarossa,
 over it in another roome which to come
to, wee passed up sixe and thirty staires which as
the other was supported by twelve Pillars of Co∣rinthian
worke and Jasper stone, in which is pain∣ted
to the life (which they say, was done by

Apelles
 and 
Michael Angelo,
 the one the master
the other the man) are the Images of 
Lycurgus,
Zeno, Aristocrates, Aristides, Agathocles, Phoci∣on,
Anaxagoras,
 the first Triumvirat of Rome,
thence by thirty steppes more into the State-house
it selfe, which is a most curious peece of Worke,
without Pillers, peeced with 
Onyx
 and 
Smarage,

two excellent kindes of 
Marble,
 found in the 
Te∣neriffe

a mountaine of 
Tiroll,
 it is about the Walles
painted with the Stories of all the gods, painted
by 
Raphael Urbine,
 some twelve yeeres since, a∣gainst
this State-house stands a goodly Fountaine
in the middle on a Pedastall of Brasse, the Statue
of 
Augustus
 environed with all the gods and god∣desses
to the number of forty in Brasse in 
Polonian

Cassockes and 
Turkish
 Scymiters by their sides, in
the middest of the high street is another of 
Mer∣curie,

and at the farther end 
Hercules
 in a Lions
skinne killing of 
Hydra
 with his seventy heads all
in Brasse, which as soone as he strikes off one head,
two ariseth in the place, there are besides in this
Towne many other rare things, as an Arsenall brave


Monasteries Fugger house, water workes most in∣numerable
and admirable rare and curious buil∣dings
and what not to delight the eye, heere his Ex∣cellency
staied a weeke. And thence on Sunday,
hearing the Emperour was a comming to 
Regen∣spurg,

departed that day being the one and thir∣ty

Niburg
 takes his name, it

Boristines
 which is of a
blacke colour, as rising out from the cole Mines
of 
Epirus.


The next day through 
Swaben
 and to 
Ingolstate

the strongest Towne in all 
Mesia,
 which is a part
of

King of Swe∣den

and killed his Horse under him, whose skinne is
preserved still for a Relique in the Arsenall, it is
the stronger having the 
Danu

men all in red Coats, guarded on the armes, with

Excellence

to goe and view their 
Stathouse,
 which is a large long
building of Stone, above an hundred paces in length,
passing first up 5. ascents of Staires, & through a long
Gallery 90. paces long, ruffe cast with severall stories,
and at the end entered into a square chamber, which


sometimes is their Councell-chamber, so into the se∣cond,
third and fourth roome, which is twenty eight
paces long, and twelve in breadth, painted above
head, and carved very richly; and on one of the Walls
hang the Pictures of the sixe 
Caesars;
 First, 
Carolus
Magnus, Rodolphus Primus, C{us}. Mundus, Rodolphus
Secundus, Mathius Primus,

then into the fifth roome, which was furni∣shed

which they presented his

From hence, we went to view one of their Houses,
in which amongst the rest of his Pictures, was the
picture of his Grandfather, who had neyther nose nor
chin; as the picture demonstrateth; and then presen∣ted
his 
Excellence
 with a Banquet: from hence to ano∣ther
faire house adjacent, and very well furnished
likewise, but before we came into the rooms, we went
up the curiousest Stayre-case of stone as ever I have
seene.


And from hence to the Castle, where the Father of
one of the Lords lived, who after he had shewed his

Excellence
 all the roomes in the Castle, which adjoynes
to the wall of the Towne, standing on a Hill, and a
very deepe Well of one hundred and fifty Fathom,
cut out of a Rocke, by which they were constrayned
to releeve the Towne, in the time of their former
warres, betweene the 
Emperor,
 and the King of 
Swe∣den;



he presented his 
Excellence

and then returned home.


The next day, which was Sunday, they all dined
with his 
Excellence.


And in the morning being the 14. day, wee departed
having stayed heere three dayes, and tooke a Convoy
of 100. Musketiers along with us to 
Neustadt,
 five

Dutch
 miles; The first night, travelling part by
Torch-light through the Woods, and there lay on
the straw that night: which Towne formerly hath
beene inhabited by 250. Burgers or more, and not
having now five in it.


The fifteenth day earely, thence to 
Ketzen
 five
miles, and there lay on the planchers likewise; and
the next day to 
Wirtzburg
 to dinner, which was three

Dutch
 miles,
 staying that night there, having no o∣ther
Towne neere to goe to. After dinner, the Lords
of the Towne sent his Excellence a present of Two
and thirty Flaggons of Wine, Fish, and provision for
his Horse.


The next morning before his Excellence departed,
he was visited by the Bishop of 
Wesburg,
 whom wee
found, in the habit of a Countrey Gentleman, setting
aside his Order, which is an enamelled Crosse han∣ging
on a Blacke ribbon about his necke; who made
very much of his Excellence, and presented him with
the Picture of our 
Ladie,
 done by 
Albertus Durerus,

being one of his best peeces; and then tooke leave of
him, who was ready to ride out of Towne, to some
other place for safety, the 
Swedes
 being within two
dayes march of it, and then his Excellence returned


to his Lodging, and presently went away.


The seaventeenth day, taking a fresh Convoy went
to 
Bishopsheim
 that night,
 a Towne seated in a bottome,
and incompassed round with Hills, having the River

Tauber
 running about part of it, belonging to the Bi∣shop
of 
Mentz;
 travelling this day foure 
Dutch
 miles
and most part through great Woods.


Earely next morning, thence through 
K
lsen
 a Vil∣lage,
and divers other poore Villages burnt and pilla∣ged,
passing through a hilly wooddy Countrey in
much danger of the 
Croats,
 and spying some running
up and downe in the Woods, being round about us,
in number 6000. or more, dispersing themselves in∣to
severall Companies, pillaging and robbing of the
Countrey; travelling this day five miles to 
Milde∣barke,

but a 
Dutch
 mile before wee came thither, en∣tered
into our old way at 
Nunkirken,
 the poore burnt
Village before mentioned, which is now inhabited by
some Foure or five poore people.


The 19. day in the morning, from thence another way,
taking another fresh Convoy, leaving our old way and
the 
Maine
 on our right hand, passing along by the
side of it, through 
Hybach
 a Village, and a faire House
which is the Bishop of 
Mentz
 likewise, and through
other Villages miserably battered, and in Plaines
some sixe 
English
 miles in length, untill wee came to

Selgenstadt,
 having gone this day sixe 
Dutch
 miles.
Falling into our old way within one mile of the
Towne, travelling all those dayes in danger of the

Croats,
 where as soone as his Excellence lighted, the
Grave 
Vandosme
 Governour of the Countrey for


the Bishop of 
Mentz,
 sent his Excellence a present
of halfe a wilde Bore, and likewise provision for his
Horse; knowing that the Towne could not affoord
any thing.


The twentieth day being Sunday, early in the mor∣ning,
wee went thence to 
Frankfort
 to dinner, which
was three 
Dutch
 miles.


And the next morning after, his Excellence went to

Hannaw
 to visite Sir 
Iames Ramsey,
 a 
Scotch
 Gentleman
and Governour of the Towne, and there stayed that
night, who met his 
Excellence
 without the gate with
a troupe of Horse, and entering the Towne there went
off a brace of Canons, and when his 
Excellence
 ligh∣ted,
went off two more by the doore of his 
Excellencies

lodging; which Towne, was besiedged a Yeare and a
halfe by the Emperours forces, and at the beginning
of the Siege had such a grievous Plague, that there
dyed in 7. Weekes, 22000. yet for all this, they kept
out the enemy, though in great want and misery, and
three months since it was releeved by the Landt-grave
of 
Hesse,
 who slew a great company of the Imperia∣lists
and drave the rest away; for as wee passed by a∣fore
at a distance, we heard them as they were in their
skirmish. The next morning, his 
Excellence
 went a∣bout
the Towne to view the Workes, which are very
strong, scarce to bee scaled by any force, having two
Engines made but of six Musket barrels a piece, which

Dutch
 Engine dischargeth 80. times together, giving
fire to it but once; the Towne is seated in a plaine
ground, having the 
Mayne
 on the East, and incom∣passed
on the North and West, with the River 
Knits∣zig,



besides Moted round, and this River serveth 14.
Mills which adjoynes to the Towne, and before any
man can enter into the old Towne he must passe over
three Bridges, and through severall Bulworkes, and
over another into the new Towne; and at the releefe
of the Town, there was one 
Daniel Lauter
 a chiefe Bur∣ger,
dyed for very joy; he being above in his house and
seeing the victory, was overcome with such a mighty
passion of joy, that hee fell downe and dyed instantly;
there was likewise a woman, who killed many Dogs &
sold their flesh at a great rate to many people, and one
day as shee walked in the Streets, was like to have been
devoured by them, had not some poore Souldiers
by chance releeved her, who presently confessed what
shee had done formerly, acknowledging she had just∣ly
deserved it; and after dinner his 
Excellence
 tooke
leave of Sir 
Iames Ramsey,
 and then returned backe to

Frankfort.


The foure and twentieth day, foure of the Burgers
of the Citie came and presented their service to his

Excellence
 with twenty flaggons of Wine, and then
dined with him; here wee stayed three dayes untill
our Boates were made ready.


And on Saturday the 26. day of 
November,
 wee de∣parted
from hence, and rowed downe the 
Mayne;

the first night to 
Flersheym,
 which was three miles, a∣gainst
which wee cast anchor and lay aboard; The
next morning launched forth, and past downe to

Mentz,
 and there his 
Excellence
 went on shore, to see
if it were any way inriched since our being there, but
alas, wee found it as miserable as before, with divers


poore people lying on Dunghils almost starved, being
scarce able to crawle for to receive his 
Excellencies

almes, and presently returning to our Boate to dinner,
wee afterwards releeved many poore hungry soules
with the fragments; Thence after dinner downe the

Rhyne
 to 
Rudeshem,
 which was five 
Dutch
 miles, and
there cast anchor, and lay on the boards likewise.


Very earely the next morning wee weyed anchor,
and presently entred into a dangerous place to passe,
called 
Bingham-Locke,
 where the River 
Lo
 falls into
the 
Rhyne
 by the Towne amongst many Rockes,
which causeth a violent fall, tossing us up and downe,
that if wee had but touched any part of them we had
all been cast away; being past this, we came to 
Bacha∣rach,

where, some of our Company did but goe a∣shore
(and presently hastened after in a little Boate,)
were pursued by five Musketiers almost to his 
Excel∣lencies

Boat, who discharged very often at them, yet
by good fortune mist them, and having overtaken his

Excellence,
 they instantly fled away; then going on to
a large Iland an 
English
 mile from 
Coblentz,
 wee there
cast anchor and lay all that night; for wee could not
passe to the Towne without leave from the Gover∣nour,
by reason of severall watches which lay in our
way; which night wee lay in much danger, percei∣ving
them walke up and downe to catch a prey, for as
some of our company did but goe a little way from
our Boat, they were layd hold on, and one that fled,
had a Musket shot at him, and hee that was taken, they
caried before their Commander, who was in a Mona∣stery
in the Iland, examining him, & then let him goe.


The next morning,
 his 
Excellence
 sent againe to the
Governour, for passage, who like a base fellow made
us stay that night also, and the next day untill three of
the clock in the afternoone, and would not let us passe,
for all that his 
Excellence
 had sent him the Emperors
Passe and Letter, wherein hee was commanded, not
onely to give passage, but, to assist him in any thing
hee required; yet for all this, hee kept us still, and
would not give way that our Trumpeter might goe
to the 
French
 in the Castle; but they perceiving how
unworthily hee did deale with his 
Excellence,
 dis∣charged
4. or 5. Cannons at his house, and shot quite
through it, at last hee came at the third sending for,
with an excuse, hee was very unkindly delt with by
Cardinall 
Genetta,
 the Popes 
Nuntio,
 who lately passed
by, going to 
Colle
,
 but stayed him three dayes first,
before hee let him passe, and made him promise faith∣fully
not to visit the 
French,
 but being got beyond the
Towne landed and went in, which made him vow
not to let any passe. But after that hee had talked a
while with his 
Excellence,
 gave leave to fall downe
neere the Towne, and having cast anchor, set a strong
watch about us, and then gave leave for the Trumpe∣ter
to goe to 
Monsieur Salade
 in the Castle for pas∣sage,
who most willingly granted it, and sent his

Excellence
 a very faire ancient Picture; but hearing
by the Trumpeter the Governours base usage towards
his 
Excellencie,
 presently plac'd their Canons against
his house, and vowed his Sonne should give fire to
them the next morning, and would send him such a
breakfast, as that hee should need no dinner; in the


interim, there came a Lieutenant from the Gover∣nour,
upon a colour to visite his 
Excellence,
 who
proved a second Villaine in the end, for all that wee
used him very well, and fedde his hungry belly bet∣ter
than it had beene long before; for the Souldiers
themselves confessed, that they had but one Browne
loafe and a halfe of Bread in eight dayes, and not one
penny of money; yet this Rascall lay lurking in our
Boate till our Trumpeter returned, and then violent∣ly
tooke him and the Skipper, and carried them into
the Towne and set a watch about them; and the next
morning, sent his 
Excellence
 word hee might passe,
but the Trumpeter should follow after; whereupon
his 
Excellence
 sent his Steward to know the reason,
who found them tyed by the Armes together, the
Skippers finger cut off, & the Trumpeters head escaped
very narrowly from being cloven in two, had not his
strong Hat defended it, and also had threatned to hang
them up the next day together, but with much adoe
hee brought them away with him, and after followed
a Gentleman to excuse that barbarous base usage of
the Lieutenant, and leave to passe, presently depar∣ting,
and being gone but a little past the Towne and a∣gainst
the Castle, they saluted us, and said they would
drinke the King of 
Englands
 health, and then gave
fire to more than twenty thundring Cannons, beside
a brave volley of small Shot, which made their Hou∣ses
to smoake and tumble in our sight, but they durst
not returne one backe againe; the other Governour

Geats,
 gave us very noble usage, but this who was
lately sent, shewed himselfe so base, that he deserves


no name with us; from hence to 
Bonn,
 and there cast
anchor, but durst not lye nigh the Towne, the Sick∣nesse
being very sore in it, and this day rowed eight
miles.


The next day being the first of 
December,
 in the mor∣ning
we went from thence to 
Collen,
 being foure miles,
leaving those delightfull Mountaines, Hills, and plea∣sant
Vines, and entred into a plaine Countrey, where
as soone as wee came into the Towne, neere the Pa∣lace
where the Cardinall lay, had information, of all
what the boorish Governour of 
Coblentz
 sayd of him
was false; wee stayed heere three dayes untill wee
had exchanged our Boates for bigger, and every day
his 
Excellence
 had presented unto him 24. Flaggons
of Wine, sent from the Magistrates; who once dined
with him.


And on Sunday the 4. day of 
December,
 about foure
of the clocke at night tooke Shipping, and the next
morning at three a clocke set sayle, and sayled downe
by 
Mulheim
 on the left side of the 
Rhyne,
 and 
Sonts

on the other side, which belongeth to the Abbots of

Collen,
 where wee stayed to free Toll; then on by

Newse
 on the same side, where the River runneth out
to it,
 and so to 
Dusseldorpe,
 where as soone as we came
but neere the shore, out came the Noble Duke of

Neuburgh,
 and clambered over other Ships to come
into ours, to visite his 
Excellence,
 being much joyed at
his safe returne, and had made provision at his House
to entertaine his 
Excellence,
 but perceiving he would
not stay, sent for a wilde Bore, Wine, and five Pic∣tures,
and presented them to his 
Excellence,
 then


tooke his leave, being very sory to let him goe, but
considering the time and tediousnesse of the weather,
was more willing to give leave, he staying by the shore
untill wee put off, and then went off 10. Cannons,
the Duke still walking along the shore as farre as the
water would give him leave, and stayed untill we were
out of fight. From thence by 
Keiserswert
 belonging
to the Elector of 
Collen,
 seated on the left side of the

Rhyne,
 where wee were stayed to free our Toll a∣gaine,
and at our lanching forth saluted us with one
Peece of Ordnance, so on by 
Ordingen
 a little Towne,
where on the other side, about a league further wee
cast anchor, against a small old Castle called 
Enger∣sort,

sayling seaven leagues and a halfe this day, for
before wee went by miles, which were some foure or
five 
English
 miles at the least in length, but these are
but three English; this night wee lay in much danger,
for there did lye on each side of us, parties, which
robbeth and pillageth all Passengers; for wee saw a∣bove
fifty in a company, going all along by the shore,
but a little before wee cast anchor, and at 10. of the
clocke in the night being very darke, was a false ala∣rum
given by the Watch of a partie comming, which
made us all flye to our weapons, at last perceiving it
was but one Boate, and they that were in it, crying
out Friends from the Duke of 
Neuburg,
 else wee had
shot them, who came for to have passage into 
England.


Next morning earely wee weyed anchor, and went
part of the day in danger likewise, to 
Orsoy,
 the first
Garrison Towne of the 
States,
 where we were stayed,
and our Ship searched what wee carried, but at our


putting off, they gave us two Pieces of Ordnance; so
from thence along by 
Rhineberg,
 against which there
lay a man of Warre of the 
States,
 who saluted us with
three Pieces; then by 
Buricksweasell,
 and a league fur∣ther
we cast anchor in the middle of the 
Rhyne,
 say∣ling
this day but 4. leagues and a halfe, by reason of our
stay at severall Toll places.


The next day earely in the morning, set sayle, and
sayled downe by 
Rhees, Emmericke,
 and by 
Schenck-Schants,

which is now new built and well fortified a∣gaine,
where wee left the 
Rhyne
 and that on our right
hand, and went downe in a deepe River called the

Wall,
 by 
Nimmegen
 a faire Towne, seated on the East
side of the 
Rhyne
 on a hanging Hill, where the Go∣vernour
of the Towne, Sonne to one of the 
States,

came forth and tendered his service to his 
Excellence.

In which Towne there dyed this Summer 12000.
people of the Plague, but now thankes be to God, it
is almost ceased: from thence, passing by severall

Redoubt-Houses
 built at every halfe league, in which
there lyeth a Watch continually to keepe the River,
passing along untill wee came to the fourth House;
where, for all wee told them it was an 
English
 Ambas∣sador,
shot foure or five Pieces at us, and mist some of
us very narrowly; whereupon wee cast anchor, and
lay in the middle of the 
Rhyne,
 but could not cer∣tainly
learne who they were, sayling this day seaven
leagues.


December
 the 8. in the morning, wee set sayle and
went to 
Teill,
 being but two leagues, and could not
passe any further for yee, but sayled in great danger


thither of splitting our Ship by the violent force of
it, which caused us to stay there three dayes, untill we
heard there might be a passage cut over the 
Rhyne
 at

Viana;
 departed thither upon little Sledges, on Sun∣day
the eleventh of 
December,
 and passed over great
quantities of yce, through 
Burem,
 where the Prince of

Orange
 hath a faire Castle, thence to 
Culenburg,
 and
so to 
Viana
 to Bed, travelling with much labour
some on foot, others by the sledges this day 6. leagues,
where Sir 
Ferdinando Curie,
 an English Gentleman,
entertained his 
Excellence
 that night, the Towne is ve∣ry
pleasantly seated upon the East side of the 
Rhyne,

and the 
rest thinges in it, are Flowers, for there was
a 
Tulip-roote
 sold lately for 340. pounds, as Sir 
Fer∣dinando

informed his Excellence.


The next morning, wee tooke Boate and crossed o∣ver
the River though with much danger and difficulty
in the wet, the winde and tyde contrary, being got a∣shorm,
went to 
Vtrecht
 where we lay that night, which
was but 2. leagues, and where there then dyed of the
Plague 80. a weeke, but a little before 300; from
the 
 to 
Leydon
 next day to Bed, travelling very late,
and 
ght leagues this day; where some of the Princes
the Queene of 
Bohemia's
 Sonnes, were at Schoole,
whom his 
Excellence
 presently visited, and there met
with some Gentlemen, which the Queene had sent to
meet his 
Excellence,
 and two of her Coaches to fetch
him to the 
Hague.


The next day before his 
Excell
 went away, he view∣ed
the chiefe things of note in the Towne, as the Vni∣versities,
the 
Anatomie
 Schoole, which before we had


not leysure to see, and from thence after dinner to the

Hague,
 which was but 3. leagues, being Wednesday
the 14
th
. day of 
December,
 and their 
Christmas
 Eve.


Thus leaving his 
Excellence
 at the 
Hague,
 I went
for 
Amsterdam
 that famous Citie,
 first by Waggon
to 
Harlem,
 which was five leagues, where I lay that
night, being a very well built Towne, the next day
to the Citie it selfe, which was three leagues, passing
all the way upon a Cawsey, by 
Harlem-Meare
 on my
right hand, and the River 
Tey
 on the left, and entred
in at 
Harlem-Port,
 and past through all the new
Towne, and over three large 
Graufts, Princes, Keasers,

and the 
Heares Grauft,
 these Streets be three Quarters
of an English mile in length, two hundreth paces in
bredth, having an even row of stately beautifull Buil∣dings,
and Trees planted the whole length of the

Graufts
 side, and so into the old Towne, which is not
of so stately a building, but the whole Citie is built
upon Piles in the water, and a great Channell runneth
through every Street for the Marchants ships to sayle
to their doores, their 
Exchange
 is built much like
unto that in 
London,
 both beneath and above, but that
it wants a little in breadth, with water running under
it, there is a very large building called the 
Weishouse,

wherein all poore Children, Fatherlesse, or of decay∣ed
Parents, are there maintained and brought up, and
there is now at this present time 800. all clad alike,
the one side of their garments Blacke and the other
Red; there is likewise foure Hospitals adjoyning one
unto another, for Men and Women to be severed each
from other, the East and West 
Indian
 Houses, two


rare Builings and curious within, and many other
delightfull things to please the eye, heere I stayed
two dayes; and on Saturday the 17. day of 
December,

at 5. of the clocke at night, tooke a 
S
utz
 drawne by
a Horse, and went up a River along by the side of the
Cawsey; than I passed downe on before to 
Harlem,

and there at 10. of the clocke in the Evening tooke a
Waggon, and travailed all night to the 
Hague,
 which
was five leagues; but ferried over the 
Rhyne
 at two
in the morning, and got thither by 8. of the clocke;
where wee stayed Eight dayes,
 and the most part of
the time was spent at the Queenes Court, and the rest
in visites, betweene the Prince of 
Orange,
 the 
States,

and three Ambassadors which were there; as Mon∣sieur

Charnesse
 from 
France,
 Seignior 
Carmerarius

for the 
Swedes,
 the 
Venetian
 Ambassador, and the
Count of 
Culenburg;
 but hearing our Ship was come,
his 
Excellence
 tooke leave of the Queene at 10. of the
clocke at night, and came away next morning being
Wednesday, the one and twentieth of 
December,
 and
Prince 
Maurice
 along with him to 
Keswicke,
 where
the Prince of 
Orange
 hath a House, which his Ex∣cellence
viewed, and then the Prince taking leave re∣turned
backe againe, and his 
Excellence
 rode on for∣ward
in her Majesties Coach to 
Delft
 where he dined,
in which Towne there are as many Bridges as Dayes
in the yeare, and so many Channels and Streets, where
Boates doe passe up and downe, and one common
Passage under a Church-yard, under which wee did
passe, from thence by a Scute to 
Rotterdam,
 where we
lay, which is from the 
Hague
 five leagues, untill that the


winde served us, and then on Saturday being the 24. of

December
 (and 
Christmas
 Eve by our stile) at a 11. of
the clocke in the night, tooke Boates and went to our
Ship, sayling first through 
Magan Sluce
 to 
Helver-Sluce,

where our Ship called the 
Garland
 did ride at
anchor, and about 3. in the afternoone set sayle, and
sayled over the Barre, having a Pilate sayling before
us with a Lanthorne on the top of his Mast, sounding
for the depth all the way; and the next day at twelue
of the clocke cast Anchor in the 
Dounes,
 and there rid
and could not land for the roughnesse of the Sea, un∣till
Tuesday morning the 27. of 
December,
 and then
landed at 
Deale,
 and from thence by Poast to 
Can∣terbury,

and so to 
Sittinburne
 to bed.


The next day in the morning earely to 
Gravesend,

and there tooke water for 
London;
 where on the way,
my Right Honourable Lady met his 
Excellence,
 who
exchanged Barges, and there she entertained him with
a Banquet, and so earely the next morning, went to

Hampton
 Court to his Majesty.


FINIS.
